<p>When you setup a new recipient online, your bank will ask to jump through a telephonic security hoop to confirm that you aren't a naughty hacker. Quite rightly so.</p>
<p>However this becomes an issue if you have hearing issues, back in August 2011 I had a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/AskLloydsTSB/status/109233455879036928">@AskLloydsTSB</a> about adding some on-screen instructions detailing the timings of the call as a simple workaround.</p>
<p><strong>They did it within a few hours</strong>. I consider this the best piece of reactive design I have ever experienced.</p>
<h2>It's no longer suitable</h2>
<p>Even though my hearing is fine, I <em>always</em> use the non-hearing approach to make sure that it's still functional. Today it failed me. The automated message has changed and I have realised that the transfer amount also affects the timings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;TEN PENCE&quot; - a mere moment</p>
  <p>&quot;ONE THOUSAND, NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE POUNDS AND SEVENTY TWO PENCE&quot; - somewhat longer</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The proposal</h2>
<p>By sending the 4-digit code to the user via SMS they could enter it on-screen for the same level of security (verifying the user is who they say they are). Furthermore it will be FULLY accessible to the hard-of-hearing community.</p>
<p>Interface-wise we only need one additional page to deal with the SMS instructions and input; there's no need to have an additional screen to choose between SMS and Voice as this choice can be added to the &quot;create new recipient page&quot;.</p>

  <figcaption>As you can see, the changes would have minimal effect on the interface, and with my experience<br>as a programmer I'd be confident that the backend logic would be straightforward too.</figcaption>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: To the LloydsTSB employees reading this; I hope that you take these graphics and arguments, take them to your boss and impress the shit out of them. I don't even care if you pass it off as your brainchild and get a fat rise and employee of the month, if it gets done you will make the hard-of-hearing community proud!</p>
<p>And with that I must bid LloydsTSB Godspeed!</p>
