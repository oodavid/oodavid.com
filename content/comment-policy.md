## Add Value

Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in

If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

## Keep it tidy

Help make my life easier by taking a moment to ensure that what youâ€™re about to post is appropriate. That means:

* Don't post off-topic comments or discussions
* Don't cross-post the same thing multiple times
* Do read the entire article before asking questions, it may already be covered
* Do skim through the comments to see if there's a related thread already
