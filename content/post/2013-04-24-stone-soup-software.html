<p>Stone-Soup is a folk tale my Grandfather was fond of; it's about a cunning old lady who persuades a community to come together and make &quot;stone soup&quot;. It starts with a simple enough premise: she already has the magic stone, all she needs now is some hot water to make a hearty soup for all! Flabbergasted, the community agree to play along as it sounds too good to be true! After all, it's only a wee splash of hot water right?</p>
<p>Of course adding a little salt <em>really</em> brings out the flavour of the stone. It's obvious. Some poor sap adds salt. And so it goes until pepper, potatoes, onions, mutton, carrots, split-peas, stock, turnips, celery, cream and barley are all added... the stone soup is truly wonderful! Who would have guessed?</p>

<p>No matter how fast paced life becomes, people are still people. In software terms the cunning old lady represents a client, the soup is the software, and the ingredients the features. And I hear stories like this all the time from my peers - hell, <a href="/2011/09/09/2011-my-journey-so-far.html">I've been duped before</a>.</p>
<p>The way I see it: there are 2 types of cunning old lady to be wary of:</p>
<h3>Naive old ladies</h3>
<p>Truly believes hot water will turn her magic stone into soup! Her belief and passion is so strong that you might end up falliing for it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This type of client is either naive to the world of software or just plain ignorant of it. Having never pondered beyond the user-interface or basic concept she is blind to the time, forethought and plethora of decisions and hard work that goes into everything her UI or concept represents.</li>
	<li>Not necessarily new to software - consider public sector workers with limited hands-on knowledge, accidental managers and all those <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html">not-good software developers</a> (sorry guys).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deceptive old ladies</h3>
<p>Carefully massages your expectations so that <em>you</em> believe water is all that is needed to make soup.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This type of client needs a big mind-map to keep track of their white-lies and half-truths. They know what they want and their machiavellian ways will make you their puppet.</li>
	<li>Not necessarily software experts - be wary of anyone with arrogance or confidence in their profession; both traits are transferrable and if you let your guard down you could mistake them for inside knowledge and experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>God forbid you ever meet some terrifying hybrid of both.</p>
