<p>I love Thursdays, I love all days really; there's always something happening to make you smile! Yesterday was no exception, after a good day's graft <em>(I must blog about this contract soon)</em> I popped over to the Codeworks <a title="Ignite site" href="http://ignite.oreilly.com/">Ignite</a> event to have my neurons tickled and tickled they were!</p>
<p>The first speaker <a title="Love your larder" href="http://www.loveyourlarder.com/">Tristan Watson</a> (a beautiful soul) talked about how an idea is only important once it's been acted on and to my mega joy he used one of my sideprojects as an example!!!</p>

<p>We then watched Dan Gilmore talk about immersive technologies, a new face to me but so passionate! Love it! He sparked the memory of a thought I had as a child; <em>&quot;what would swapping sensory inputs feel like?&quot;</em> - if there's another Ignite event I may ask to talk about this cause it's such a giggle of a thought experiment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let the truncation begin - I should be working!!</em></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>We heard about finances from Jonathan Gold<br/><strong><em>I noted that I need to talk to him about a concept business plan with a super-short-term exit strategy</em></strong></li>
	<li>Peter Hirst talked about hidden gems and easter eggs in technology<br/><strong><em>Sparked another weekend tinkering of an idea, maybe next month ;-)</em></strong></li>
	<li>Dan Kolodziej (pronounced ko-lod-gee) went on a MEGA-TANGENT starting with shoes, onto Wi-Fi, cruised through Africa, financial institutions, and back to shoes again. DAN'S SHOES that is.<br/><em><strong>Reminded me of frontline SMS - must see how that's evolving soon</strong></em></li>
	<li>David Erasmus (what a name!!) showed us some heart-warming holiday snaps then asked us about the nature of openness and friendship and why things happen the way they do<br/><em><strong>I wrote - must buy a school bus</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>I had to cut the event short cause to cycle home and make SUSHI!!!! Yes.</p>

<p>I didn't get a shot of everyone; there was no incentive to move <em><strong>away</strong></em> from the food. That's just dumb. That last sushi was named <em>&quot;the loneliest maki&quot;, </em>we proceeded to make it some &quot;friends&quot; then eat them too. We all had to lie down and ride it out cause we made soooo much!</p>
<p>Don't forget kids, every night is food night</p>
