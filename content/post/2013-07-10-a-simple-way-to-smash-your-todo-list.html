<p>I am a big fan of todo lists, I like to ponder my workload on the ride to the office and jot a list every morning as I sit down at the desk; it helps keep me productive.</p>
<p>It's best to allocate times to your tasks to help visualise how your day will go. In doing this you will know what needs to be done before lunch, and before you go home etc. Invariably there will be too much on the list, but that's OK as it will keep your day jam packed and productive.</p>
<p>If you have work that requires your focus on a computer screen, may I suggest you...</p>
<h3>...unplug your laptop and go somewhere quiet!</h3>
<p>This one comes from my habit of taking my laptop home from work without a charger; that way I know that I wont waste my evening being a zombie when I should be doing other things. Like living my life.</p>

<p>I'm writing this article &quot;unplugged&quot; as part of a set of tasks that <strong>will</strong> take me 3 hours. I'm confident in my timing as I only ever get 3 hours out of this poxy battery.</p>
<p>Right then, gotta dash, stuff to do and all that!</p>
