<p><strong>CONSUME! DIGEST! ENJOY!</strong> You are now eating my favourite breakfast evar. It's just the job; one pancake usually does for breakfast (lunch, tea etc) unless you're a greedy bugger like me in which case you'll need two to make you groan and moan. WITH JOY.</p>
<p>Recipe for the Buckwheat batter (to make about 6-8 pancakes):</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>mix up this lot</em></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>80g of buckwheat flour</li>
			<li>80g of chestnut (or regular wheat) flour</li>
			<li>pinch o' salt</li>
			<li>2 beaten eggs</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>then gradually stir in</em></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>160ml milk</li>
			<li>240ml water</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>and finally add</em></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>a wee splash of olive oil</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use it straight away if you like, but it's at it's best after resting in the fridge for a couple of hours. BLAMMO.</p>
<p><em>Next time I might find the lowest denominator for the measures; tis always easier to multiply UP than divide DOWN. Hmm...</em></p>
