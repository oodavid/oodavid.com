<p>Today was the first proper meeting between myself and Ben &quot;Presentation Player&quot; Cooper, we decided last week that an ideal and productive way to teach / learn JavaScript concepts would be with a real-world project. So we planned:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Presentation-Player/Tweakr/network" title="Tweakr on GitHub">Tweakr</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>A javascript plugin for tumblr themes</li>
	<li>that tallies up the tags used by the blogger
		<ul>
			<li><em>or uses cached data from localstorage (for speed)</em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>and renders a tag stats graph  
		<ul>
			<li><em>with logarithmic &quot;levels&quot;</em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan has 5 main parts to it (tis on the whiteboard atm):</p>
<ol>
	<li>polling the tumblr api and collating tag data</li>
	<li>storing a cache of data (for speed)</li>
	<li>the stats design and DOM injection</li>
	<li>creating a simple webpage with instructions on how to install</li>
	<li>hosting the site on Amazon S3</li>
</ol>
<p>After a quick planning session we went over a few basic javascript concepts: code structure, for loops, the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/" title="$.each">$.each</a> helper, the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/%20" title="$.getScript">$.getScript</a> AJAX shorthand and basic Tumblr API usage.</p>
<p>If everything goes to plan, we should be online after about 4 or 5 sessions, keep y'all posted!</p>
