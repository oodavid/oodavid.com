<p>Hello world<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>After a 6 month stint with social startup <a title="happiest - positively social" href="http://happie.st/">happiest</a><sup>2</sup> I find myself re-kindling my freelancing career, before I can begin touting for work I have a rather long list of due-diligence that must be completed, the meat of which comprises of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Update <a title="David King - creative problem solver - web developer and programmer" href="http://oodavid.com">oodavid.com</a> to act as my portfolio</strong><br/><em>something quick and succinct, with testimonials and a call-to-action</em></li>
	<li><strong>Update my legal documents and contracts</strong><br/><em>I'm making some changes on account of recent lessons learned</em> </li>
	<li><strong>Formalise my agile processes for new clients</strong><br/><em>I used to work on an ad-hoc basis which is fine when working with decent clients however the past 3 years of startup culture has brought agile to the table, awesome</em></li>
	<li><strong>Rebuild my network of freelances with whom I can rely on</strong><br/>I last freelanced over 3 years ago and my little black book does no justice to the excellent freelancers and talents that I've encountered in my time away</li>
</ul>
<p>I've given myself a fortnight to complete these tasks and I'm looking forward to each and every one of them! And with that I must big you adieu, I'm ahead of schedule and am starting to plough through my legal documents. Awesome... </p>
