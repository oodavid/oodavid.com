<p>Well that was exciting! For a moment Nelson de Craab was in the lead only to be pipped by OOSubs after a dinner party and some in-person votes were cast - crazy times. <em>They could have Tweeted me from the other end of the room... some people eh?</em></p>

<p>So on the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> of November I shall be doing a power session <em>(possibly at the <a href="http://culturehacknorth.co.uk/2011/09/culture-hack-north-leeds-2011/">Leeds Culture Hack</a>)</em> working on the OOSubs project! I'll not be going in blind though - at some point between now and then I'll sketch up a set of wireframes that I reckon is doable in the timescale, I'll keep you all posted :-)</p>
<p>Serious thanks to everyone that voted; what better than a vote when you're feeling indecisive?! Brill.</p>
