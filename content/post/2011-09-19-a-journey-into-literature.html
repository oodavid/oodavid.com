<p><em>With the recent passing of the inspirational and &quot;unreasonable&quot; <a title="Michael S. Hart" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart">Michael S. Hart</a>, founder of <span><em><a title="Project Gutenberd" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></em></span> I thought that it would be good to share my sapling journey into literature.</em></p>
<p>I've had a recurring conversation with my programming peers that once you've finished your day of coding <em>(aka, reading and writing)</em> the idea of staring at a book for a few hours sounds too much like work. In the new year I made myself a promise; to start my journey reading &quot;important&quot; books; sure, knowing the latest trends in HTML5 is handy but being able to chat away with my friends and strangers about more popular books and topics is just epic.</p>
<p>On the recommendations of Roz and her family I started reading Jasper Fforde; he may be the <strong>perfect</strong> writer with which to start a journey into literature; he's funny, intelligent, silly and the focus of his books is literature itself - I promptly read the entire &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Eyre Affair - Jasper Fforde</li>
	<li>Lost in a Good Book - Jasper Fforde</li>
	<li>The Well of Lost Plots - Jasper Fforde</li>
	<li>Something Rotten - Jasper Fforde</li>
	<li>First Among Sequels - Jasper Fforde</li>
</ul>
<p>Epic. After that I promised to give Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice a read, I now understand why Jasper Fforde writes them central to his novels - because they're excellent! The stories are well known so I'll skip those and just note that the writing styles of both are just beautiful, I really like the idea that a writer can skip over &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;banal&quot; segments and just focus on the important bits - took that one onboard :-)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austin</li>
	<li>Jane Eyre - Charlotte Brontë</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up was a bit of a read of necessity, those that know me personally will understand why I felt it was important to read about The Eden Project in Cornwall (lets just say that I visited recently with a &quot;side project&quot; in my pocket). This book was really insightful; I was hoping for a romantic story of flora and fauna but while that served as the preface and backdrop the majority of the book was about the unlikely people that made the project a reality - it's quite astounding that The Eden Project exists. My hats off to them all.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eden - Tim Smit</li>
</ul>
<p>My most recent read is Slaughterhouse-Five, a short and fragmented anti-war book written about (in a roundabout way) the Dresden Bombing in WWII. The one thing that I will take away from this book is the idea that all the moments in our lives will always exist, it's simply our experience of time that makes us think otherwise.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death - Kurt Vonnegut</li>
</ul>
<p>So that brings us up to the now, I have quite a list of books I want to read but next up is one I read as a teenager on the recommendation of one of my favourite teachers, Mr Hunter (Physics). It's about how we perceive dimensions and reality; I think it will be the right bedmate to Slaughterhouse-Five with it's warped sense of time.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions - Edwin A. Abbott</li>
</ul>
