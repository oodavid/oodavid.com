Over the past few days I've been revamping **oodavid.com** in terms of direction and style. While considering my work I took the opportunity to also review my choice of static-site-generator (SSG).

Jekyll was such a no-brainer at the time; SSGs were in their infancy and GitHub offers free generating and hosting of Jekyll sites. The _development_ cost to me was negligable. Fast-forward a number of years and the SSG space has exploded, in fact, it feels like the choice of programming languages grows with a power-law!

## Direction



## Style

Purple-pink gradients? That's _so_ 2017.

It may seem like a radical departure from the previous style, but that's largely aesthetics. In terms of layout the site is nigh-on identical, we have a single-column with:

* Header
* Navbar
* Content
* Footer

UX is hard, until it isn't - for **oodavid.com** I couldn't justify the effort of departing from the perfectly functional structure.
