<p>So you saw the raw projector mount I rigged up on Saturday right? Well I spent some time on Sunday painting the &quot;screen&quot; with whiteboard paint; now I have a home cinema <em>and</em> somewhere to brainstorm my ideas - huzzah!</p>
<p><em>[I was going to upload a picture of a white wall, but I'm confident you can imagine a large white square in a sea of magnolia... you're an intelligent bunch]</em></p>

	<figcaption>the projected image looks considerably sharper for the white surface (&#8216;twas magnolia), plus if you lie on the floor you can pretend you're at the cinema :-)</figcaption>

<p>I used 2 tins of <a title="Promain Paint" href="http://www.promain.co.uk/product/Rustoleum_Dry_Erase_Paint_whiteboard_id4091">Rust-Oleum Dry-Erase Paint</a> bought via Promain (next-day-delivery) and cost me ~£45, when you consider the cost of a new whiteboard-screen it works out rather cheap. If I was painting a larger area I would probably try ideapaint.com.</p>
<p>I think I'll be rigging up <a title="Johnny Lee!" href="http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/">interactivity with a Wiimote</a> when I can slot in the time, that'll be fun :-)</p>
