<p>Having been involved with a number of &quot;bootstraps&quot; <em>(4 in a row!)</em> I found myself struggling a little with my personal cashflow... cash<strong>flaw</strong> might be a more appropriate name TBH.</p>
<p>So anyhow; last year after a joyous debacle I decided that it was pertinent that I took the bull by the horns and really get to know just how these things work. Today I find myself more than comfortable with finances from the personal level all the way to large-company level <em>(double-entry basics, debit, credit, invoices, credit-notes, credit-ratings, credit-insurers yada yada)</em> and today I would like to share with you a pretty powerful spreadsheet that I use to analyse my personal bank account.</p>
<p><a href="http://oodavid.com/finances/template.ods">http://oodavid.com/finances/template.ods</a> - designed for <strong>Open Office</strong>, <em>sorry Excel users, but it probably doesn't work! Feel free to port it :-)</em></p>
<p>It's been tweaked and tinkered with and I think I'm finally happy with it. It's designed to be a no-brainer to user:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Paste in your bank statement at the end of each month</li>
	<li>Assign each transaction a category</li>
	<li><em><strong>Magic happens</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are 14 tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>About</strong> - this explains how it works and allows you to set some variables that affect the way the thing works</li>
	<li><strong>Money</strong> - this is your balance sheet if you will, or a summary of your monthly spendings and earnings with opening balance, closing balance and a grouping of how you spend your cash</li>
	<li><strong>April &gt; February</strong> - this is where you paste your bank-statements then categorise each transaction, once you've done that the <strong>Money</strong> tab is automagically updated!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by selecting the category the transaction is added to the correct month / category cell on the <strong>Money</strong> tab (click for a bigger image)</em></p>
<p>So every month I paste in my statement, categorise each item <em>(about 60 on average)</em> and then I have a number of useful things in my possession:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An exact breakdown of how much I'm spending and earning in different areas (groceries, clothes, electronics etc).</li>
	<li>An intimate knowledge of my money. Quite a handy thing when you want to budget etc.</li>
	<li>Proof. Just in-case the taxman or some other arsehole needs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please download it and have a tinker, if I make your life a teeny tiny bit better just give me some love and we're even :-)</p>
