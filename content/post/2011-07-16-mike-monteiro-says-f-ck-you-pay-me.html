<p>I recently came across a most excellent video from Mike Monteiro (Web Designer Guru) focussing on the topic of getting paid by clients. It takes a very legal approach (his lawyer is with him onstage) and covers various topics such as kill-fees, your rights as a freelancer, using Intellectual Property as leverage for final payment and introduces several scenarios that are all too familiar with much of the audience.</p>

<p>The talk is a contributing factor to my ever growing interest in the legal processes of working freelance or in a small company; My &quot;shitlist&quot; for next week includes creating a legal timeline along with supporting documents, contracts, terms and conditions; I'm even speaking to awesome designer <a title='Graeme "Grabbins" Metcalfe' href="http://grabbins.com/">Graeme &quot;grabbins&quot; Metcalf</a>Â about designing a gorgeous one-page infographic that illustrates the process. It's gonna be gorge.</p>
