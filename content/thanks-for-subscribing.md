Thank you!

You've joined a small, but growing community of developers, great stuff!

By subscribing, you encourage me to create new Articles and Modules. I'm open to suggestions for new content, please do get in touch with me at [david@oodavid.com](mailto:david@oodavid.com); I read my inbox daily at around midday and try to respond to all messages.

You'll get an email now from Mailchimp confirming your subscription, and emails in the future when I next release an Article or Module.

Kind Regards,<br>
**David "oodavid" King**
