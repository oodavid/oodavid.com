title: GViz Mister! Embeddable graphViz

<p>As a visual thinker I always keep at hand a scrapbook, notepad or whiteboard covered in diagrams of various design; my favourite being flowcharts and spider diagrams. I find it very easy to group similar concepts or dependencies by visualising my scribblings, I can still picture a valuable diagram that has long been tossed in the paperbasket.</p>
<p>I've recently become a <strong>big</strong> fan of <a href="http://graphviz.org/">graphViz</a>, a program that allows you to create &quot;graphs&quot; by defining the connections between nodes. It's a splendid piece of kit that is childs play to use, for example this diagram...</p>
<figure>
	<script type="gviz" data-layout="dot"><![CDATA[
		digraph G {
			graph [
				truecolor=true
				bgcolor="#FFFFFF00"
			];
			node [
				shape=box
				style=filled
				fillcolor="#FFFFFF"
				fontcolor="#0F192A"
			];
			david -> notepad -> offline;
			david -> scrapbook -> offline;
			david -> whiteboard -> offline;
			david -> graphviz -> online;
		}
	]]></script>
</figure>
<p>...is trivial to describe using the graphviz language, the layout and format is automatically calculated for you:</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">
	digraph G {
		david -> notepad -> offline;
		david -> scrapbook -> offline;
		david -> whiteboard -> offline;
		david -> graphviz -> online;
	}
</pre>
<h2>Let's make that embeddable...</h2>
<p>Normally you would have to fire up the command-line and run graphviz to convert your definition into an image to then view, however I've found these diagrams to be a critical part of my toolbox and have created an online webservice that allows them to be embedded directly into a webpage. No more command-line needed, just instant gratification!</p>
<p>Head over to my <a href="/gviz/">GViz documentation</a> page to see how to embed graphs directly on your webpage...</p>
