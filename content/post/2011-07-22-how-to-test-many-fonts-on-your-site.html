title: How to test many fonts on your site?

<p>I've been pondering today about how the quickest and easiest way to test-drive different fonts, like hundreds of them, on a website... tinkering with the fontsquirrel and google fonts libraries I found myself speccing up a browser plugin / extension based around this piece of code:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">$('head').append('&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster+Two&amp;v1&amp;v1" /&gt;');
$('body').css('font-family', "'Lobster Two', arial, serif");</pre>
<p>...as you can see, if you dumped this into into the console on a site with jQuery it will switch out the font assigned to the body allowing it toÂ cascade down through the DOM.</p>
<p>Which leaves me with the question; would it be productive to write a chrome extension where you can select any of the freely available hotlinkable fronts and apply it to a website? I think it would! Weekend project here we go :-)</p>
<p>Beer first.</p>
