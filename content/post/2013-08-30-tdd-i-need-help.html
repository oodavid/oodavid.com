title: TDD - I need help!

<p>Test-Driven-Development. I understand the principles, I've read the books, I've gazed at source codes and other projects that successfully employ it, and yet I still don't use it in my work.</p>
<p>I've been developing <a href="http://www.lucion.co.uk/nexgen/" target="_blank">NexGen</a> since July 2011 and it's been operational and profitable since May 2012; I've released almost daily updates to the program and is now in a sort of plateaux where everything functions as expected and most of the remaining roadmap items are &quot;nice to have&quot;.</p>
<p>The main problem I have is that my software is large, mature and mostly bug-free; retrofitting TDD could <strong><em>add</em></strong> bugs!</p>
<h2>Err, so why do you want to use TDD?</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;If a company’s own research does not make a product obsolete, another’s will&quot;</p>
	<cite>Theodore Levitt</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not content with it's current incarnation, I want it simpler, faster and more useful. Further than that I want to be confident that if / when I leave the company and hand my work over to another developer that he has all the necessary tools to maintain and develop the product.</p>
<p>A big part of that is TDD; how could a stranger be confident that he hasn't b0rken everything? I think TDD would give that confidence.</p>

<h2>Can you help?</h2>
<p>I don't want to rewrite my code, but I do want to be able to test it. All of my important features are centred around database operations; as such my tests could be summed up as:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>When I perform &quot;X&quot;, the database MUST have valid structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything I've read about TDD has skirted around databases (mostly ignoring it altogether) and as such I have no inroad or lead to follow in order to design the tests that I deem most important.</p>
