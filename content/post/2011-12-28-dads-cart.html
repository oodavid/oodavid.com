title: Dad's Cart!

<p>It's been a while since I've blogged, but my word have I been a busy boy! I've decided to quickly take the opportunity to blog about one of my simpler (ie, quicker to write about) projects; a small jQuery script that adds shopping cart functionality to a website. I wrote it as a small favour for my Dad and is aptly titled &quot;<strong>Dad's Cart!</strong>&quot;, we've already added it to 2 websites and I'm sure I'll use it again :-)</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://oodavid.com/dadscart/">http://oodavid.com/dadscart/</a><br/><em>see it in action here, with instructions</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It works completely on the frontend using localStorage to store the users cart, all the developer needs to do is tweak their markup a little and you're off. What it doesn't do is validate the data, nor connect to an e-payment system, that's your call. <em>For us, we had 1 site connect to Barclays PDQ and another to PayPal, so we left the payment part out :-)</em></p>
