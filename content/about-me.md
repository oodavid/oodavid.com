I'm **David King**, a full-stack developer based in the UK, I focus on Javascript and Typescript and have worked my way through many platforms and frameworks. From Angular to Firebase, Node to MongoDb, Gameclosure to CouchDb and PouchDb. My skills are broad and well suited to the online space.

My systems have helped numerous companies run efficiently and to profit; from Advertising Agencies to Startups, Building Surveyors and Fleet Management specialists.

I work for <a href="//accredible.com">Accredible</a>, a great company based in Silicon Valley.

I can be found moonlighting for pleasure and profit.

## Work Ethic

When proposing software solutions for business, it is rarely enough to take client requests at face value. I strongly believe that a deep understanding of my clients business and goals is necessary to create software that is fit-for-purpose.

> "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."
>
> ~ Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird

Many software-engineers will focus solely on technical problems and fail to fully explore their clients' wishes from a business perspective. I have made it my mantra to continually learn about my clients' business as though they were my own, immersing myself in the day-to-day working of each company. This enables me to create streamlined, tailor-made processes that help businesses grow and profit.

I present myself not as a "software-engineer", but as a business consultant with specialist knowledge in programming.

## Supplementary Knowledge

During the course of my career, I've accumulated a breadth of knowledge in many disparate subjects; each serving to enhance my abilities to deliver fit-for-purpose software.

* Business processes, division of labour
* Surveying, floorplanning, interior architecture
* Double-entry bookkeeping, accounting, finance, debt recovery
* Corrosion, surface treatment and protective coatings
* Psychology, cognitive biases
* Game theory, genetic algorithms
* Virtual stock markets
* _I could go on..._

This reflects the clients I've worked with, and those I wish to work with in the future - I'm genuinely thrilled to "skill up" in new areas.
