title: CSS / jQuery how to toggle scrollbars for a lightbox

<p>A few months back I was reverse engineering the Facebook photo overlay and noticed that they have employed a very neat trick with-regard-to scrolling; when the photo &quot;popup&quot; is active, the body underneath does not scroll.</p>
<p>It's a very subtle UI feature but fixes a thoroughly annoying &quot;bug&quot; for many people. Normally when you view scrollable content in a &quot;lightbox&quot; you would scroll to the bottom of the lightbox and then the PAGE UNDERNEATH STARTS TO SCROLL too, what a buggerlug.</p>
<p>The trick is to simply prevent the body from scrolling; using a little CSS we can set the <strong>body</strong> overflow to be hidden (removes the scrollbars) and put a margin on the <strong>html</strong> to stop the page moving about (body would expand into the space the scrollbar was otherwise):</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript;">/* Don't scroll */
html.noscrollbar {margin-right: 15px;}
html.noscrollbar body {overflow: hidden;}</pre>
<p>Or if (like me) you'd prefer to leave your CSS be and implement it with jQuery:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript;">// Remove the scroll
$('html').css('margin-right', '');
$('body').css('overflow', '');<br/>
// Return the scroll to normal
$('html').css('margin-right', '15px');
$('body').css('overflow', 'hidden');</pre>
<p>I use the jQuery method in a hush-hush project that I've been working on for the past few months (and for the foreseeable future*) here's a not-too-revealing screenie</p>
