<p>I've had such a lovely time this festive season; lots of food, lovely people and a few odd party-games. I hope you've all had a great one too!</p>
<p>At the stroke of midnight I made 3 resolutions<strong>*</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Bendy</li>
	<li>Handy</li>
	<li>Teeth</li>
</ol>
<p>I bet you're thinking <em>&quot;what a weirdo, they're not resolutions&quot;</em>, but there's wisdom in the brevity and I assure you they will serve me well!</p>
<p>Instead of &quot;Bendy&quot; I <em>could</em> write &quot;do yoga every week&quot; but what if I don't like yoga? What if pilates is my poison? If I miss a week will I give up? Lets be honest, it's a possibility! By simply saying &quot;Bendy&quot; I can have that running in my mind as a little mantra as I go about my business, it'll seep into the cracks of my year and God help me I <strong>will</strong> be a bendy man!</p>
<p>What about &quot;Handy&quot; then? Well, right now I <em>really</em> fancy going on a journey into woodworking and most likely that'll be what I end up doing to start with, but as with the &quot;bendy&quot; I'm free to meander into electrics, metalwork etc. etc.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Teeth&quot;... well I haven't been to the dentists in <strong>over a decade</strong>, my teeth look fine, but I'm pretty sure I need a filling or two...</p>
<p><strong>That's all very well David, what about last years? How did they go?</strong></p>
<p>Well, last year I only made 2 resolutions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Posture </li>
	<li>Books</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of which I feel I have made great progress with! Hurrah!</p>
<p>My back and shoulders are looking great, I sometimes catch myself slouching a little but I correct it ASAP. TBH, I didn't really expect this one to be so enjoyable, it's really satisfying being the tallest person at the table (even a shortarse like me can tower over a 6ft something with lesser posture). Brilliant.</p>
<p>As for the books, I reckon I've averaged about 1-per-week for the year. Including the Harry Potter series, lots of Jasper Fforde, a stack of classics and quite a few business books. While my memory is still shockingly bad, I feel I've gained a lot from this one, not-least being that my reading speed is getting better with every book!</p>
<p>With a couple of wins under my belt I feel confident that <strong>I will be a well-postured, bendy, well-read handyman with a killer smile</strong>.</p>
