<p>When it comes to databases, I've tried to keep myself in the know about all the tools, features and best-practices even if I never utilise them. It's useful to be aware of the things you have yet to learn so that should you ever come accross a new problem your ability to think outside of the box is improved by an incling of an idea.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this week I've finally needed to use MySQL PROCEDURES and TRIGGERS to help compliment some of the more complex queries we need to run <em>(the details of which are beyond the scope of this wee blog post)</em>. And I quickly came about an issue regarding PARAMETERS that has had me scratching my head for some time.</p>

<h2>The evolution of a PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>Lets start with a simple SQL query, you want to increment a column for a specific row:</p>
<pre id="sql1" class="brush: sql">
	UPDATE `mytable`
		SET `mycolumn` = `mycolumn` + 1
		WHERE `id` = 1234;
</pre>
<p>Then you want to make your query more dynamic by utilising User-Defined Variables:</p>
<p><em>...maybe you are using prepared statements to similar effect...</em></p>
<pre id="sql2" class="brush: sql">
	SET @myid = 1234;
	UPDATE `mytable`
		SET `mycolumn` = `mycolumn` + 1
		WHERE `id` = @myid;
</pre>
<p>Finally you decide create a PROCEDURE that you can call like a function:</p>
<pre id="sql3" class="brush: sql">
	DELIMITER $$
		DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `MyProcedure` $$
		CREATE PROCEDURE MyProcedure(IN myid INT)
		BEGIN
			UPDATE `mytable`
				SET `mycolumn` = `mycolumn` + 1
				WHERE `id` = myid;
		END $$
	DELIMITER ;
</pre>
<p>That procedure is then stored within the database and can be used by any connection later:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">
	CALL MyProcedure(1234);
</pre>
<p>Works a treat. But to get to that functional PROCEDURE I took a massive, confusing detour...</p>

<h2>Where I went wrong</h2>
<p>If you look at the 3 statements above you will notice:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first uses an explicit <a href="#sql1">1234</a> within the statement</li>
	<li>The second uses the <a href="#sql2">@myid</a> User-Defined Variable</li>
	<li>The third uses a <a href="#sql3">myid</a> Parameter variable
		<ul><li><em>Note the lack of @-sign</em></li></ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>The following PROCEDURE uses BOTH @variables and paramenters:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">
	DELIMITER $$
		DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `MyProcedure` $$
		CREATE PROCEDURE MyProcedure(IN myvar VARCHAR(255))
		BEGIN
			SELECT myvar, @myvar ;
		END $$
	DELIMITER ;
	-- SET @myvar then call the procedure
	SET @myvar = 'variable';
	CALL MyProcedure('parameter');

	-- +----------+-----------+
	-- | myvar    | @myvar    |
	-- +----------+-----------+
	-- | variable | parameter |
	-- +----------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>You can see that the PROCEDURE has access to both the User-Defined variables AND the parameters. Very confusing.</p>
<p>Lessons learned? MySQL PROCEDURES have access to Session scope. I don't know why, but I wouldn't have expected that.</p>
