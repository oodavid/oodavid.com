<p><em>Fun fact: when I was 17 I learned from my brother that you can just walk into random lectures at University and people probably wont notice, I did that for a few months and it was awesome. If you're lucky it will be a good lecture :-)</em></p>
<p>So anyhow, yesterday was rather epic - <a title="Durham Lane" href="http://www.durhamlane.co.uk/">Richard Lane</a>, sales-dude extraordinaire, got my little neurons fired up about how we communicate and think about sales and after-sales processes and logic. Frankly a lot more than I can cover here (I have work to do) suffice to say it was very insightful, go see the man if you can! Why? This is why:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Richard's language and presentation style is incredible, he has just made an example sales pitch for <em>NOTHING</em> and I want to buy it. Whatever it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>One of the things he presented was a concept for sales Qualification called The Magic 35 Qualification Toolkit™, which reminded me of my Leads Profile Radar Diagrams (earlier blog post). So last night with an hour free I decided to knock up a &quot;radar maker&quot; that we can use to generate Lead Profiling diagrams and Magic 35 diagrams.</p>

</ul>
<p>Ultimately I hope to add more presets for other stages of the sales process to make up:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lead Profiling</li>
	<li>Qualification</li>
	<li>Requirement</li>
	<li>Evidence</li>
	<li>Acquisition</li>
	<li>Closing</li>
</ul>
<p>Hurray for brainwaves!</p>
