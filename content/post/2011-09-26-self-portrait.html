<p>Might use something like this for my business card - I don't have one yet y'see. Needs text though, how abooouuut:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>oodavid! what a nice business card you have...</strong><br/><em>aka &quot;the classic&quot;</em></li>
	<li><strong>David King - create problem solver - full service web development</strong><br/><em>aka &quot;what it says on my website&quot;</em></li>
	<li><strong>David King - STRAIGHT UP NERD</strong><br/><em>aka &quot;the reality&quot;</em> </li>
	<li><strong>David King - who ate all the </strong><strong><span>π</span></strong><br/><em>aka &quot;welcome to my brain&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
