<p>When designing interfaces for the web, a lot of people use the <a title="960 Grid System" href="http://960.gs">960 grid system</a> or something similar as a layout system. Loving numbers as I do, <em>I have π tattooed on my arm after all</em>, I decided to explore the reasoning and logic behind the much adopted 960 system.</p>
<p>The 12 column layout that is core to the system is a <a title="Highly Composite Numbers on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number">highly composite number</a> ie. it has a large number of divisors; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12 even columns to be precise - AWESOME. So this means when you go about designing your layout you have a great deal of flexibility and choice - ♥ MATH.</p>
