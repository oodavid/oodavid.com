<p>We'd been A-B testing a new &quot;login with Facebook&quot; and &quot;login with Twitter&quot; links alongside the regular email and password form.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Group A - Half of our users see the normal register and login with email option</li>
	<li>Group B - This half <strong>also</strong> see the extra login / registration options</li>
</ul>
<p>We noticed that Group B (those with <strong>three</strong> login choices) were having increased login failure.</p>
<p>After a little research we came across an astounding article from MailChimp covering this exact scenario, I'd be foolish to think I could express this problem nearly as well as these guys, suffice to say that we've came to the same conclusion... an excellent (if a little lengthy) read:</p>
