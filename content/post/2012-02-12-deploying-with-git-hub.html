title: Deploying with Git(HUB)
url: /2012/02/12/deploying-with-git-hub/
---

<p>The last post about deployment was good, but I ran into a few problems to do with submodules. I am developing 3 web-apps in parallel that all use common code, so in keeping with DRY methodology the apps simply link to submodules in order to share code. With the technique outlined in the previous post submodules were not automatically updated; making it all but useless for my needs.</p>
<p>So today I have quickly researched and utilised an alternative - using github features to trigger automatic deployment.</p>
<p>In keeping with trendy trends, here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/1809044" title="Auto-deploy with php and git(hub) on an EC2 Amazon AMI">GIST on GitHub</a> - you can see that I have forked a very good gist and there's a few references in the post.</p>
<p>I have a pretty nice announcement with-regard-to my worklife to make soon, but need to wait till everything is confirmed before I do. Happy times my friends :-)</p>
