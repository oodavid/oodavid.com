<p>Tasty or what? So yes, I have been charged with the main course of <em>&quot;Boeuf Wellington&quot;</em> aka steak, pâté and pastry. In the fridge there is some most excellent mushroom and liver pâté chilling for tomorrow. It tastes sublime.</p>
<ul>
	<li>wedge of butter (70g at a guess)</li>
	<li>3 rashers of bacon,  (probably not necessary)</li>
	<li>5 shallots, finely chopped (or a regular onion)</li>
	<li>2 garlic cloves (I actually used paste)</li>
	<li>300g of mushrooms</li>
	<li>300g of chicken livers (from the Grainger Market and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/techniques/cleaning_chicken_livers" title="how to clean chicken livers, a video">cleaned</a> myself)</li>
	<li>thyme (err, a bit)</li>
	<li>splash of port (I imagine martini, sherry etc would be fine too)</li>
	<li>salt</li>
	<li>pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Melt the butter in a big pan, add the bacon, shallots and garlic, cook for 3-4 min.</p>
<p>Add the mushrooms and livers, cook until livers are seared (about 5 min for me)</p>
<p>Add the thyme, booze, salt and pepper, cook the booze off. It shouldn't be totally dry, judge the juice:solids ratio based on your existing pâté experiences (about 10 min)</p>
<p>Leave to cool for 15, then food process that bad-boy up! YUM.</p>
<p>Leave in fridge overnight and devour (I read that the paste does well to be sealed with olive oil, so you probably want to do that too)</p>
<p><strong>Serving suggestion: Apply to beef. Top with pastry.</strong></p>
<p><em>(I'll add photos of the pâté tomorrow. When it's finished)</em></p>
