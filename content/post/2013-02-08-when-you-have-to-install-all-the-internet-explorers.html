<p>You know how it is, you make something awesome for a company, they all use modern browsers, but their customers? Oh, they're still rocking IE6 and 7. I quite honestly thought those days were long behind us.</p>
<p>Well, they may seem like dark dark days, but at least we're not alone - with the advent and growing popularity of github and general open-sourcery I managed to find this GEM of a repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">https://github.com/xdissent/ievms</a></p>
<p>Quite simply, if you have Orcale VirtualBox installed you can download and install all the IE's in a command-line onner:</p>
<p><strong><span>curl -s <a href="https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh">https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh</a> | bash</span></strong></p>
<p>Isn't it beautiful?</p>
