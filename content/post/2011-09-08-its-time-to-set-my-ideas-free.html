<p>For years I've kept &quot;ideas books&quot; as a place to jot down my observations on how to improve things, create new scenarios or even just little thought-puzzles and whatnot. Looking back over them is always quite amusing; some have aged really well and some I've seen come to realisation at the hands and minds of others - awesome!</p>

<p>Flicking through the first few pages of the filthy one (2005-2008 I think) I see:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Home energy monitoring kits</li>
	<li>Kinetic mice</li>
	<li>Cashflow projection software</li>
	<li>Super-SImple-Phones</li>
	<li>Stockmarket ideasAn idea for a heist (yes really)</li>
	<li>Audio synthesis interfaces (I have a real big soft-spot for this one)</li>
	<li>Laptop &quot;unfucker&quot;</li>
	<li>A page entitled &quot;when I go to the pub I want to see tea and coffee on draft&quot;</li>
	<li>A game concept called &quot;life&quot; which starts as a sperm-based scrolling shooter / race and evolves with each stage of life</li>
	<li>Artificial Intelligence in Audio Production</li>
	<li>A logic game called cub3</li>
	<li>Open-Source music (applied to a business model)</li>
	<li>&quot;A time and a place&quot; idea to traverse music throughout time</li>
	<li>Charity concept called &quot;giveback&quot;</li>
	<li>Etymological language browser</li>
</ul>
<p><em>and then some</em></p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that some of them will likely be unattainable by me and so have decided to find the right company for the idea and will pitching it to them in a short video. I shall immediately write another blog post for the first &quot;pitch&quot;...</p>
