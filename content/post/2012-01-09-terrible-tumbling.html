<p>You we're going to get a post titled <strong>&quot;scope is spaghetti&quot;</strong> but instead I'm going to try my best at being angry that my blog was hacked by a tumblr theme (you saw the posts, let's not be sheepish).</p>
<p>You ready? Here goes...</p>

<p>For now, I'm going to use this ill-fitting theme while I have a scour of the internets for something more suitable. Oddly, I found a rather nice premium one t'other day but foolishly I didn't bookmark it. <em>I ain't even angry.</em></p>
<p>Suggestions on a postcard...</p>
