<p><em>I'll announce the winner of the &quot;weekend project&quot; poll in the next post ;-)</em></p>
<p>These are the rules that I give myself when drafting my daily task list. Your task list MUST...</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>be the first thing you do every day</strong><br/><em>I write mine after breakfast before brushing my teeth / showering etc</em> </li>
	<li><strong>use yesterdays list as a startpoint</strong><br/><em>in case there's anything incompleted or left-over</em> </li>
	<li><strong>fit on a small piece of paper</strong><br/><em>I usually go for a piece of A4 folded twice, gives you 8 days of lists :-)</em> </li>
	<li><strong>have estimated times for each task<br/></strong><em>this helps you stay on track as you work</em></li>
	<li><strong>have a bonus item at the end that you want to do<br/></strong><em>only tackle this if you complete your list, gives you something to look forward to!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So for example, today I have:</p>

<p><em>&quot;intentions&quot; is a little idea I'm throwing about, if I create the wireframes I can happily file it away in my ideas box knowing that the soul of it is not lost should I wish to pursue it another day</em></p>
<p>Most of the rules cobbled together from a book called <em>&quot;The Decision Book: Fifty Models for Strategic Thinking&quot;</em> which I read in the bath a few months ago - for serious workers I now consider it an essential read! GET ON IT FOLKS</p>
