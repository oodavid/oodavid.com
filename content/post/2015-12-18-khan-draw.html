<p>I've been spending a lot of time using <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan-Academy</a> to brush off some Math and Biology cobwebs. Great fun!</p>
<p>The format of the videos appeals to me; a simple sketch with voice-over. I decided to see if I could replicate their toolchain in the browser:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Sketching App</li>
	<li>...which records the screen</li>
	<li>...captures the microphone audio</li>
	<li>...and spits out a video</li>
</ul>
<p>I was initially concerned that screen recording would be impossible, but a quick search led me to a couple of great projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC">RecordRTC</a> - for recording videos in the browser</li>
	<li><a href="https://bgrins.github.io/videoconverter.js/">videoconverter.js</a> - a javascript port of ffmpeg, for merging and converting seperate video and audio streams</li>
</ul>
<p>Standing on the shoulders of these giants, I created <a href="https://draw.oodavid.com/">khan-draw</a>! This is the output:</p>

<p>The source-code is <a href="https://github.com/oodavid/khan-draw">available on github</a>, but please give it a go at <a href="https://draw.oodavid.com/">draw.oodavid.com</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the project, I've made note of them on the project (click the &quot;info&quot; button)</p>
