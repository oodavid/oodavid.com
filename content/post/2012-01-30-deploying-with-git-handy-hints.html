<p>With regards to deploying your site with git, there's some potentially confusing posts out there; a quick google for &quot;git deployment&quot; will turn up a few (seemingly) outdated posts (I'm using <strong>git version 1.7.4.1</strong> at the time of writing), ie:</p>
<ul>
	<li>

		<em>I had a few problems with this one when I got to the push stage, apparently this occurs with newer versions of git.</em>

		<em>while written for specific deployment platforms I ran into the same problems as the ryanfolrence post</em>

		<em>now we're talking! Not only is this kept up-to-date but works a treat :-)</em>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a peek at the <strong>toroid</strong> post you'll read:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The one-line summary: push into a remote repository that has a detached work tree, and a post-receive hook that runs &quot;git checkout -f&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I now understand to mean:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>When you push to a remote repo a script will run that updates another directory (that's the &quot;detached work tree&quot; bit)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfect! I've already got my servers up and running so I don't want to start moving directories about the place, so for me this is what I did to pretty seamlessly add git deployments</p>
<ul><li>Create a git repo in <strong>/var/www/html.git/</strong></li>
<li>Have that repo update my working directory <strong>/var/www/html/</strong></li>
<li><em>err... that's it!</em></li>
</ul><p>SSH into the remote machine...</p>
<pre class="brush: bash;"># Move to the /var/www/ folder
cd /var/www/
# Make a new folder for our bare git repo
mkdir html.git
cd html.git
# Intialise a bare git repo
git init --bare
# Create our post-receive hook file (this simply writes 2 lines to the file)
echo -ne '#!/bin/sh\nGIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/html git checkout -f' &gt; hooks/post-receive
# Make our post-receive file executable
chmod +x hooks/post-receive</pre>
<p>On your local machine you can now push to the remote repository and your working directory will be updated:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash;"># Add the remote repo
git remote add www ssh://username@IPorURL/var/www/html.git
# Now push
git push www master</pre>
<p>And you're done. That was simple!</p>
<p><strong>Quick word of warning</strong></p>
<p>My local repo also runs on a local server, for me I must be careful of my /uploads/ folder as scripts can write to that directory, I don't want those files tracked by git so I use a .gitignore file to make sure that no hiccups occur in that department :-)</p>
