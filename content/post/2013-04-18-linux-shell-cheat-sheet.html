<p>Quite honestly this is just a memory exercise before I start work today, how many of my favourite Linux commands can I splurge before 9am?</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">High-Level-Programmer</a> I don't do a great deal of work with threading, system processes or anything remotely concerned with system architecture - which is reflective of the kinds of shell commands I use on a day-to-day-basis.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
	#############
	## HISTORY ##
	#############

		# View shell history
		history

		# Search through shell history
		[CTRL]+[R]

	###########
	## FILES ##
	###########

		# Dump a file to the terminal in it's entirety
		cat "/path/to/file"

		# Read the first 10 lines of a file
		head -n 10 "/path/to/file"

		# Read the last 10 lines of a file
		tail -n 10 "/path/to/file"

		# Read the last 10 lines of a file AND follow it for changes
		tail -n 10 -f "/path/to/log.txt"

		# Read huge files in a lazy manner with keyboard scrolling
		less "/path/to/file"

		# Open a file with it's default application...
		# ...using a new thread so the shell isn't locked
			# XFCE
			setsid exo-open "/path/to/file"
			# Gnome
			setsid gnome-open "/path/to/file"

		# Recursively restore "default" CHMOD permissions for files and folders
		find "/path/to/folder/" -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755
		find "/path/to/folder/" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 644

	## FINDING STUFF ##
	###################

		# Locate files with an exact name, case-insensitive
		locate -i -b '\avatar.png'
		
		# Locate files using a regex pattern... ie:
			# ending with .png
			locate -r '\.png$'
			# ending with .png in a folder called "img"
			locate -r '\/img\/.*\.png$'

		# Using grep to narrow down a shell output
			# You need to know your ethernet Mac address so you type...
			ifconfig
			# ...but you're feeling lazy and don't want to read the whole thing!
			ifconfig | grep -i ethernet
			# Or you need to quickly find a particular error in your server logs
			grep -i "file does not exist" "/path/to/log.txt"

		# Finding the full path to a command
		whereis cat
		whereis less
		whereis whereis # This command tells you the path of the command that tells you the path of a command...
