<p>Try and buy a &quot;non poop&quot; ceiling mount for a projector and you'll be lucky to get one for under £40, so I did the logical thing and made one for about £2.50 - and it's perfect for my needs! Hurray for wood :-)</p>

<p>To finish the job I am applying Rust-Oleum Dry-Erase paint onto the surface opposite to act as a dual purpose mega-whiteboard and projector screen. Tomorrow.</p>
