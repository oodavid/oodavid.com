<p>I like games, but I rarely get the chance to play them. My favourite are games that are hard, like <em><strong>reeaally</strong></em> hard, that make you think, that make you hurt. In business terms it's a terrible idea to ostracise your target audience to any degree, as such these games are a rare beast.</p>
<p>At the start of the year I found myself yearning to get back to my codey roots and have a tinker with games, I spent a lazy Sunday writing and doodling about the various half-baked ideas that I've had over the years and finally remembered a game that we played as kids called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAhLKcuKO1s" title="Chiral Gameplay" target="_blank">Chiral</a>, man that game ticked all my boxes.</p>
<p>In the style of a man that has a 1001 things to do I started tinkering anyhow...</p>

<p>Thusfar I have created:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A decoupled &quot;grid engine&quot; to power any number of games on grids</li>
	<li>A proof-of-concept implementation that presents a grid of atoms, each has a random valency and can be connected to create molecules.</li>
	<li>A simple scoring engine that rewards massive molecules</li>
	<li>Some intro levels that explain how to play the game (not shown in the video)</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design some different game-modes; timed, clear the board, &quot;match 3 style&quot; (where more atoms drop down when cleared etc), puzzle</li>
	<li>Make the intro levels work really well</li>
	<li>Get some music made for it - probably by <a href="http://echolevel.co.uk/">Brendan Ratliff</a>, possibly in the style of <a href="http://youarelistening.to/deepthought">You Are Listening to... Deep Thought</a></li>
	<li>Make some sexy visuals / animations - <em>I find this quite daunting</em></li>
	<li>Reprogram it for Android (native) and iPhone (native) -<em> it's currently just Javascript</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, and make it REALLY SWEARY. I don't know why, but I like the idea of having the avatar being frustrated by the game and pouring out a constant torrent of abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Molecule? Bollecule!</strong></p>
