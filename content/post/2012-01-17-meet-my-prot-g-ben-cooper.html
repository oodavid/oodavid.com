<p>Having worked a little with Ben last year, I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email asking if I'd be willing do some tutoring in the ways of javascript; what a major compliment! I've just returned from our first meeting at the Settle Down Cafe <em>(notice the pointing dude behind Ben? Legend of a gent, another story)</em>, it has indeed been settled, we're to meet every Tuesday in the name of javascript :-) I may have never met a more keen chap than Ben, he's chomping at the bit and I am very excited to see how the tutoring comes along. Good times my friends, good times.</p>
<p>We (very quickly) skimmed over some of the obstacles and have decided to tackle a real-world idea I've had sitting in the sketchbook; it's very javascripty, not overly complex, covers all the basics (DOM manipulation, asyncronous API wetwork etc) and at the end of it there's going to be something to put our name to. After that? Who knows.</p>
<p>More blogposts when it happens :-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: What's a little odd is that when I worked with him I gave him the nickname padawan. Maybe I planted the idea many moons ago and it's just come to a meaningful fruition? Magic.</em></p>
