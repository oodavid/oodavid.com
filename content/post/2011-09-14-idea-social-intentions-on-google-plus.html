title: Idea - Social Intentions on Google Plus

---

<p>An idea to evolve the way events work on social platforms like Google Plus / Facebook; to create a step before the event called an intention. These intentions give users a place to discuss the idea, to set a date etc.</p>
<p>The intentions could also act as a sort of &quot;to do&quot; list with people - it would be lovely to visit someone's page and be reminded of the things that you agreed to do someday and be able to discuss them and make them a reality.</p>
