<p>Good programmers are always itchy to learn something new.</p>
<p>Last week I decided it was time to give oodavid.com a bit of a dusting - I used this as an excuse to learn how to use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> and the splendid Jekyll system that is available.</p>

	<figcaption>A bit like Portal, run your code through Jekyll and out pops a proper website! Magic.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The process has been fun and straightforward:
<ol>
	<li>install ruby</li>
	<li>install the jekyll gem (and some dependencies)</li>
	<li>setup a folder hierarchy</li>
	<li>make some header and footer HTML snippets</li>
	<li>make some templates (blog and homepage)</li>
	<li>test it locally using the jekyll server</li>
	<li>push to github</li>
	<li>rejoice</li>
</ol>
<p>There's no point in writing up a tutorial since <a href="http://brianscaturro.com/2012/06/12/blog-with-jekyll-and-github.html">Brian Scaturro</a> has done such a good job!</p>
<p>I did however write a simple PHP script to port over all my Tumblr posts into the Jekyll format. I'll write that up in the next post!</p>
